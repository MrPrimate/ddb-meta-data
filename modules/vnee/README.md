# Vecna: Nest of the Eldritch Eye

Something sinister lurks beneath Neverwinter. A dead militiaman. A desiccated eyeball. Whispers of a mysterious cult. What evil festers in the bowels of the city?

*Vecna: Nest of the Eldritch Eye* is an adventure for a party of four to six characters of level 3. Assemble your party and get ready to enter the catacombs of Neverwinter in this prelude to *Vecna: Eve of Ruin*. The return of one of D&D's greatest villains begins here!

- A one-shot introductory adventure to a multiverse-spanning campaign, great for new and experienced players alike!
- A new playable map in D&D Beyond’s Maps.
- Continue the journey in *Vecna: Eve of Ruin*, where your characters will immediately jump to level 10 and advance all the way to level 20 over the course of the campaign!
