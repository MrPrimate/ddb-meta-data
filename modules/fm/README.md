# Flee, Mortals!

Monsters that are fun to run AND fun to fight.

Remember the first time you slew a dragon? What if all combat encounters could be that exciting? Monsters are central to D&D, whether we’re fighting them or fleeing from them. For friends immersed in an adventure, there’s no greater thrill than a wave of angry bandits charging over a hill or a reality-warping gibbering mouther.

*Flee, Mortals!* presents an innovative approach to monster design. This book is filled with threats of all shapes and sizes. Discover synergizing stat blocks, companion creatures and allies who level up alongside the heroes, and encounters that are as fun for a DM to plan as they are for adventurers to play.
